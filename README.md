# IST-256-Final-Project
Attached is the datafile from kaggle.
It is a CSV file which I have modified to only display the parts we need, I got rid of the steps to take as we can use an API to show them.
The rows and columns numbers are not equal to pythons version of them, so it might take a couple tries to locate the right rows and columns when writing the code
